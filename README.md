Tools and tricks for the cryptoanarchy deb repo builder

DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION!

This is a set of tools (scripts) for making installation of [cryptoanarchy debian repository](https://github.com/debian-cryptoanarchy/cryptoanarchy-deb-repo-builder) easier and quicker when testing something. It lacks e.g. verifying signatures (for now) and some of the scripts are build in a relatively naive way so there may be scenarios it just simply doesn't work.

It is required to run the scripts as user which is probably not needed in all cases but it is the way it is for now.

Use it only for testing purposes, research and looking around.
